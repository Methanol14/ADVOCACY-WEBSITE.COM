            <h3>Take note!</h3>
            <p>The use of leopard skins in fashion is not only ethically questionable but also environmentally devastating. 
                It fuels the illegal wildlife trade, which in turn drives these iconic creatures closer to the brink of extinction. 
                The demand for leopard skins perpetuates the cycle of poaching and habitat destruction, pushing these animals to the edge of existence.</p>

                    <b>Leopard skins</b> have been used historically in various products, but it's essential to note that the use of real leopard skins is illegal and highly 
                    unethical in most parts of the world today due to the conservation status of leopards. Instead, I'll provide examples of products that may use synthetic 
                    materials or prints that mimic leopard skin patterns:

                    <b>Footwear: </b>Leopard print is commonly used on shoes, including high heels, flats, sneakers, and boots. Vegan and cruelty-free shoe brands often offer leopard-print o
                    ptions using synthetic materials.

                    <b>Accessories:</b> Leopard print can be found on various accessories, such as scarves, hats, gloves, and handbags. These accessories are typically made from synthetic
                     fabrics or faux leather to replicate the look without using real leopard skin.

                    desired pattern.

                    <b>Phone Cases:</b> Many phone case manufacturers offer leopard print designs for phone covers. These cases are typically made from plastic or other non-animal materials.

            <h3>READ!!!</h3>
            <p>We believe in a world where the beauty of leopards can be appreciated without causing them harm. It's time to take a stand and make a bold choice: Stop using leopard skins in all forms of fashion and
                 luxury products. Let us recognize that true luxury is not found in the suffering of animals but in the conscious, ethical choices we make as consumers and producers.</p>
